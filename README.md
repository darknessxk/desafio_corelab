# Code Challenge - Corelab

## Introduction

This is a simple project for applying to [CoreLab](https://github.com/corelabbr/corelab-challenge-web-app-php)
But maybe ill implement some extra features to make it more interesting and challenging.

Just for the sake of the challenge and to make it more interesting or maybe someone use it
as a base project for something else in the future (please, let me know if you do).

Check the other folders README.md for more information

This project took 16 hours to be done. Hope you all enjoy reading this silly code I made ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
